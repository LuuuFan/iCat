## Comments

1. Built the responsive web page by using plain html(HTML5) and css according to the PNG files.
2. Couldn't test with example test tools (i.e., Litmus, EmailonAcid) since they all required signup with credit card, even they shows free trial on their websites.
3. Since I don't have expierence for mail rendering and the mail clients. It will take time to do some research to see the specific requirements for content-rich email and different mail clients.
4. Did find a online [html email code check](https://www.htmlemailcheck.com/) to check the code. From there, I learned that I cannot use HTML5 tags for html email, so I generated another files (mail.html & mail.css) without HTML5 tags, which can be found in [mail folder](https://github.com/LuuuFan/iCat/tree/master/mail) in this repository. But without upgrading to the prime account, it still cannot test the code if it's working properly on the email clients.
5. I'd like to learn more about the mail rendering once I get the chance and enough time.
